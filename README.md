### Hello, I'm Kirill ðŸ‘‹

I like building data-driven systems. Machine learning and big data are nice (and fancy! :poodle:) means of solving ongoing real-world problems, so I try to stay on track with these two.

- :wrench: I occupied engineering roles that involved handling terabytes of analytical data, designing machine learning (ML) pipelines from scratch to MVP :seedling:, real-time :runner: processing of edge-device data, massively distributed deep learning, and :cookie: more.
- :bookmark: Mostly by luck, I happen to be a certified professional solutions architect, ML & data engineer. They also claim I know some spells :joy: to tame Kubernetes clusters :sweat_smile:.
- :bulb: I also want to engage with different communities of people as a contributor to open-source software.
