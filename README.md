### Hi ðŸ‘‹.

I'm Kirill, I build software that aims at transforming data into some value. Machine learning and big data are nice (and fancy! :poodle:) means of solving nowaday problems, so I try to stay on track with these two.

- :wrench: I occupied engineering roles that involved handling terabytes of analytical data, designing machine learning (ML) pipelines from scratch to MVP :seedling:, real-time :runner: processing of edge-device data, massively distributed deep learning, and :cookie: more.
- :bookmark: Mostly by luck, I passed some exams on solutions architecture, ML & data engineering. I also seem to know some spells :joy: against Kubernetes clusters :sweat_smile:.
- :bulb: I aim at engaging more with open-source communities, as they look like the place where new cool technology is being built.
