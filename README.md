### Hello, I'm Kirill ðŸ‘‹

and I like building different data-based things.

- :wrench: I occupied engineering roles that involved handling terabytes of analytical data, designing machine learning (ML) pipelines from scratch to MVP, real-time processing of edge-device data, massively distributed deep learning, and more.
- :bookmark: I happen to be a certified professional solutions architect, ML & data engineer. They also claim I am capable of some Kubernetes magic ðŸ˜„
- :bulb: I also want to engage with different communities of people as a contributor to open-source software.
