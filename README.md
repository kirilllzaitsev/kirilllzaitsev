### Hi! I'm Kirill ðŸ‘‹

I work with software that extracts value from different types of data that comes from visual, language, or tabular sources. I believe that machine learning and big data will be the #1 means of problem-solving in our times, so I'm trying to keep up with advances in these two.

- :wrench: I occupied engineering roles that involved handling terabytes of analytical data, machine learning (ML) pipeline design from scratch to MVP :seedling:, real-time :runner: processing of edge-device data, massively distributed deep learning, and :cookie: more.
- :bookmark: I earned several certificates in solutions architecture (AWS Solutions Architect), ML & data engineering (Google Cloud), Tensorflow and Kubernetes development.
- :bulb: I aim at engaging more with open-source communities, as they look like the place where the next technology frontier is being forged.
