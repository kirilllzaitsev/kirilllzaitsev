### Hello ðŸ‘‹ and welcome!

Few words about me. I develop software that extracts value from data originating in visual, language, or tabular sources. Machine learning and big data will be the #1 means of problem-solving in our times, so I'm trying to keep up with advances in these two.

- :wrench: I was a software engineer in projects that involved handling terabytes of transactional data, machine learning (ML) pipeline design from scratch to MVP :seedling:, real-time :runner: processing of videos from edge devices, massively distributed deep learning, and :cookie: more.
- :bookmark: Also I have five certifications under my belt: solutions architecture (AWS), ML & data engineering (Google Cloud), Tensorflow development, and Kubernetes development.
- :bulb: I aim to engage more with open-source, and I believe that this is the place where the next technology frontier is being forged.
